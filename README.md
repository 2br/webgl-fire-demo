# WebGL Fire Demo
This is a WebGL Fire Demo, a fire simulation using the WebGL graphics library. This is a project to showcase a technique of UV distortion to create visual effects, that can be used in Unity, Unreal or many Renderers. By manipulating the UV coordinates of a texture, this demo creates dynamic and interactive distortions that result in stunning visual transformations.

## Live Demo
